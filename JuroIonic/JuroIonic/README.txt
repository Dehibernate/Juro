To test this project in the browser you will need Node.js, which you can download from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once Node.js is set up, open a new command terminal and install Ionic Framework, Cordova, Gulp and Bower by typing the following:

npm install -g ionic@1.7.4 cordova@6.0.0 gulp bower

When all frameworks are installed, run the file install_dependencies.bat. This may take a while to download all libraries and initialise the project.

When finished, type the following command to test the app in a browser:

ionic serve

A new browser tab should open with the app running inside. Note that the page will refresh by itself after a few seconds to reload the libraries.
